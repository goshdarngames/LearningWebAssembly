<h1>Learning Web Assembly</h1>  

<p>
   In this page I will document my attempt to learn how to build 
   Web Assembly modules for use with my web development and games. 
</p>

<h2>Why use Web Assembly?</h2>

<p>
    Two major characteristics of JavaScript within the browser are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Interpreted</strong> - The behaviour of the code is evaluated
        during run-time.  It is difficult for an interpreter to
        optimize performance.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <strong>Dynamically Typed</strong> - Variables can change their
        data type during execution.  Their type must be checked before each 
        operation.  This can add overhead to loops with lots of maths
        inside.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These features are great for a ubiquitous web scripting language but
    they are a hindrance when writing high-performance code for a game.
</p>

<p>
    Web-Assembly allows us to compile a statically typed language such as
    C++ to a special machine code that is executed within the browser.
</p>

<p>
    This allows us to take advantage of the portability of JavaScript in
    the web browser for our user interface while compiling the 
    computationally intensive portions of our game to machine code
    for extra speed.
</p>

<h2>Basic Web Assembly Build</h2>

<p>
    To get my first Web Assembly build running I followed 
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/emscripting-a-c-library">this tutorial.</a>
</p>

<p>
   The files for a simple Web Assembly project can be found in: 
</p>

<code>./001-fibonnacci/</code>

<p>
    To build and run the <em>Docker</em> image that contains the Web
    Assembly compiler the following commands are used in a Linux terminal:
</p>

<code>
    $ docker pull trzeci/emscripten
    $ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src trzeci/emscripten emcc <emcc options here>
</code>
